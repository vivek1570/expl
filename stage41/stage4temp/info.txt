static allocation:
we are fixing the address of each variable at compile time (static allocation).

To this end, while parsing declarations, the compiler transfers the information about variables in a 
compile time data structure called the symbol table. 

For a simple implementation, a linear linked list suffices. In modern compilers, hash tables are maintained
to make search efficient.
